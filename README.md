### Technical Challenges
* Integrating Google Maps API and GeoCoding API into our features
* Setting up user authentication
* Allow for trip creation, joining a trip, and deleting a trip

## Frontend: React, Redux
We used React/Redux to create the user authentication flow for our frontend.

### Technical Challenges
* Creating user authentication forms
* Creating trip creation forms
* Creating a user profile 
* Creating a search that filters trips based on input successfully
